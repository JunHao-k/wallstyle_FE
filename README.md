## Background

For most of us, our homes serves as a sanctuary that we can retreat to after a day of work and activities. Therefore, many people will spend time and money to decorate their homes in a way that is pleasing to their eyes and help them to switch to a more relaxed mode. Interior design comes into play and an inexpensive and efficient method to quickly brighten up dull walls are hanging art canvases as opposed to having to mix and match colours to repaint walls

## Project Overview

This E-commerce project will aim to supply home-owners that wants to change the general outlook of the walls in their houses with the right art. These art will be in the form of a canvas where home-owners can choose which frames and dimensions their wall art comes in. It will allow them to take ownership of their walls design rather than depend excessively on interior designers
